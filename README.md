## Technologies Used

-Bootstrap
-Parcel
-jQuery
-Heroku
-Express

I used Bootstrap for to make use of the Carousel feature and Grid. I also used jQuery. I generally don't use jQuery, but I had to use it for Bootstrap, and it's less verbose than Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation.

I used Parcel instead of Weback as a bundler. I'm more familiar with it and I find it simpler to configure.

I set up a very simple node server and deployed on Heroku.

## Struggles

I don't use Bootstrap that often, so there was a bit of a learning curve there.

## What I enjoyed

I really enjoy writing Javascript (more than I like CSS). This site was pretty light on JS, but it's always satisfying to writ a good function.
